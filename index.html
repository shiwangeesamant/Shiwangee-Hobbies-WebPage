 <h2>Dancing</h2>
  <p>
  Dancing is something that all of us enjoy watching and some of us even happen to dance really well. I am not a great dancer but I love dancing because when I <em>dance</em>, I don't think about outside world and any problems I have in my everyday life.<em> I just enjoy the momemt</em>. Dancing gives tremendous happiness to me.
